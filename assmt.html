    HTML, CSS, JavaScript are the “big three” of web development.<br />
     Almost every website uses them in some capacity.<br />
     There are plenty of others, such as server-side languages like Java, C++, Python, and SQL,<br />
      but understanding these three is foundational to your website development knowledge.

        <h2> TO BEGIN WITH <br /> <span>here are some prescibed concepts to get started with </span> </h2>
<dl>
  <h4> <dt> Website</dt></h4> 
    
    A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content
    <br /> that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.
    <br />Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news,<br /> 
    education, commerce, entertainment or social networking.
    <br /><span> A static </span>website is delivered to a user exactly the way it's stored.
    <br /> That means that nothing on the page will change by the user or even the site administrator
    <br > unless there's a redesign of the site, or the site administrator goes directly into the
    <br /> code to change it.<br />
    Nothing is stored but the actual pages of a static site. There are:<br />
    <ol>
        <li> No users</li><br>

       <li> No comments</li><br>
       
        
       <li> No blog posts</li><br>
        
      <li> No interactivity</li> <br>
    </ol>

   <br />
   <!-- main col-->
    <img src="web stady - Copy.jpeg" > &nbsp; <img src="..//stdy.png">
    <br />
    There’s a simple way to determine if a site is dynamic.
    <br /> If you can interact with it, it’s a dynamic site. For example, 
    <br />dynamic sites allow you to create a user profile, comment on a post, or make a reservation.
<br />You’ll often hear static sites called websites and dynamic sites called web apps.<br />
 It all goes back to the idea that there are websites and web applications. A web application is a website,<br /> but a lot of websites can’t be web applications. For example, Facebook is a website and a web application.
<br /> However, a business’s simple website is not a web application.

  <h4> <dt>
    Database</dt></h4> 
     <dd>Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data.<br />
     They collect information on people, places or things.<br />
      That information is gathered in one place so that it can be observed and analyzed.<br />
      Databases can be thought of as an organized collection of information.
     <br />
      <img src="./database.png">
    <br /> 
A Databas Is used to store and manage databases that are stored on the<br /> server 
and to provide data access for authorized users.<br /> 
 This type of server keeps the data in a central location that can be regularly backed up. <br /> 
 It also allows users and applications to centrally access the data across the network.</dd>
    
    <dt>A Server</dt>
    <dd>A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user,<br /> 
     In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server.<br />
     
     <img src="what_is_web_database_processing - Copy.jpg" width="auto" height="auto">
     <br />

    As it connects users to different data functions. They house large amounts of data for organizations and make<br />
     it accessible to users through internal networks or via the internet</dd>
  <h4><dt>Domain</dt></h4>  
    <dd>
Domain names serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services,<br /> with a text-based label that is easier to memorize than the numerical addresses 
<br />used in the Internet protocols.<br />
<img src="..//dns.jpeg"> <br /> A domain name may represent entire collections of such resources<br /> or individual instances Domain names are used to establish a unique identity.<br /> Organizations can choose a domain name that corresponds to their name, helping Internet users to reach them easily.
.</dd>
<h4><dt>Host</dt></h4>
<img src="..//host-vs-server.jpg">
<dd>According to the internet host definition, a web host (or web hosting) is a service that allows individuals or<br /> organizations to post a web page or website on the internet. A web host service provider is a business that provides <br />the services and technologies needed for a web page or website to be available on the Internet.

Websites are stored or hosted on servers,<br /> which are known as special computers. If an Internet user wants to reach your website, they need to type your address into the browser,<br /> and their computer will connect to your server and deliver your website to them through the browser.</dd></dl>

        <p>HTML ( HyperText Markup Language). <img src="..//html-illustration.png" width="500px " height="300px">
            Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 Evolved the Hyper Text Mark-up Language As The (HTML) basic building block of World Wide Web.
    
             He is also known as the father of the web. In 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) became the authority to maintain the HTML specifications. HTML also became an international standard (ISO) in 2000. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. HTML5 provides a faster and more robust approach to web development.
                
            Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with references to other text that the user can immediately access, usually by a mouse click or key press.
                
            Apart from text, hypertext may contain tables, lists, forms, images, and other presentational elements. It is an easy-to-use and flexible format to share information over the Internet.
                
            Markup languages use sets of markup tags to characterize text elements within a document, which gives instructions to the web browsers on how the document should appear.

        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a standard style sheet language used for describing the presentation (i.e. the layout and formatting) of the web pages.

        Prior to CSS, nearly all of the presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup (specifically inside the HTML tags); all the font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described within the HTML.
        
        As a result, development of the large websites became a long and expensive process, since the style information were repeatedly added to every single page of the website.
        
        To solve this problem CSS was introduced in 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which also maintains its standard. CSS was designed to enable the separation of presentation and content. Now web designers can move the formatting information of the web pages to a separate style sheet which results in considerably simpler HTML markup, and better maintainability.
        
        CSS3 is the latest version of the CSS specification. CSS3 adds several new styling features and improvements to enhance the web presentation capabilities.</p>

    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

        JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
        
        JavaScript is easy to learn.
        
        This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
        JavaScript is the most popular client-side scripting language.
        Client-side scripting refers to scripts that run within your web browser. JavaScript is designed to add interactivity and dynamic effects to the web pages by manipulating the content<br /> returned from a web server.
         JavaScript was originally developed as LiveScript by Netscape in the mid 1990s.<br /> It was later renamed to JavaScript in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997. Now JavaScript is the standard client-side scripting language<br /> for web-based applications, and it is supported by virtually all web browsers available today, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, etc.
     <br /> JavaScript is an object-oriented language, and it also has some similarities in syntax to Java programming language. But, JavaScript is not related to Java in any way.
        JavaScript is officially maintained by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) as ECMAScript.<br /> ECMAScript 6 (or ES6) is the latest major version of the ECMAScript standard.
